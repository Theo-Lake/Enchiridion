    Beginning of the project. Deciding languages that I will use, what are my basic requirements, and initial "shell" programming (in terms that its just the basic stuff)

        Tech and languages:
            JSON file for information within the CV/resume
            HTML, CSS and Javascript with React framework for web development

        Requirements:
            Data can be updated easily
            Minimalitsitc and slick
            Cool animations and buttons to display css ability though not too overpowering and tedious for recruiters
            Have a Contact me button which inputs credentials and sends email to me

        Ideas:
            Scroll reveal using AOS (animate on scroll)

        Additional:
            I want this to be not only a resume but a opportunity for learning web development, thus I will not use any tutorials to creat the full cv, but
            only tutorials such as React 101, javascript beginners guide, html and css etc.
